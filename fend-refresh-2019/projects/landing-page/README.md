# Table of contents

<!-- After you have introduced your project, it is a good idea to add a **Table of contents** or **TOC** as **cool** people say it. This would make it easier for people to navigate through your README and find exactly what they are looking for.
Here is a sample TOC(*wow! such cool!*) that is actually the TOC for this README. -->

- [Landing Page](#landing-page)
- [Table of contents](#table-of-contents)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Development](#development)
- [Footer](#footer)


<!-- *You might have noticed the **Back to top** button(if not, please notice, it's right there!). This is a good idea because it makes your README **easy to navigate.*** 
The first one should be how to install(how to generally use your project or set-up for editing in their machine).
This should give the users a concrete idea with instructions on how they can use your project repo with all the steps.
Following this steps, **they should be able to run this in their device.**
A method I use is after completing the README, I go through the instructions from scratch and check if it is working. -->

<!-- Here is a sample instruction:
To use this project, first clone the repo on your device using the command below:
```git init```
```git clone https://github.com/navendu-pottekkat/nsfw-filter.git``` -->

# Usage

You can use the navigation bar at the top to move to specific section in this page. Or you can scroll down/up to see more details about each section.

<!-- This is optional and it is used to give the user info on how to use the project after installation. This could be added in the Installation section also. -->

# Development
When you add new section to the HTML file with a specific value the data-nav and it will automatically be added to the top navigation bar. The JS file add new sections to the navigation bar and handles the click events as well as the scroll events. When you click on a section name or scroll to specific section, this section changed to be in "Active" state.

<!-- This is the place where you give instructions to developers on how to modify the code.
You could give **instructions in depth** of **how the code works** and how everything is put together.
You could also give specific instructions to how they can setup their development environment.
Ideally, you should keep the README simple. If you need to add more complex explanations, use a wiki. Check out [this wiki](https://github.com/navendu-pottekkat/nsfw-filter/wiki) for inspiration. -->


# Footer
<!-- Let's also add a footer because I love footers and also you **can** use this to convey important info.
Let's make it an image because by now you have realised that multimedia in images == cool(*please notice the subtle programming joke). -->

Leave a star in GitHub, give a clap in Medium and share this guide if you found this helpful.
